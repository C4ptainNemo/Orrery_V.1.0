# STL Files of the Orrery

The gears were generated by using Fusion360's inbuilt spur gear tool and the modifying the models. The compund gears were simple, by joining two different gears into one part.

The planet ring gears were more involved. There was a single template assembly for a pair of ring gears, which had four configurations. Each configuration was then imported into its own file and modified by merging an internal gear (generated using a community tool) with each rotating ring.
