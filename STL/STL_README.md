## Notes and Thoughts on each type of parts

### Gears
The exteral spur gears were generated by using Fusion360's inbuilt spur gear tool and the modifying the models. The compund gears were simple, by joining two different gears into one part.

The planet ring gears were generated using a community tool {add name of tool}. These were then merged with the templete file for the ring gear assembly.

### Ring Gear Assemblies
The ring gear assembelies were made using a templete assembly that has four configurations, for Mercury & Venus, Earth & Mars, Jupiter & Saturn, Uranus & Neptune.
The configured assembly was imported into a new file and the required internal gears were joined to the appopriate blank inner and outer rings.
This didn't feel like the best way to do this. A better way would probably have been just modelling each geared ring as an indivdual part and then importing into the assembly.

The size of the rotating rings was to be as narrow as possible while allowing for a 1-1.5 modulus involute internal spur gear profile. The static rings were then sized to fill up the remaining space, so that there in as little gap as possible between the rings.
After completing the build I found it nice to watch the gears rotate. Since this is something designed to be looked at, covering the gears by having no gap between rings was definately a mistale. Each ring should be as narrow as possible to allow for the best viewing of the gears inside.
